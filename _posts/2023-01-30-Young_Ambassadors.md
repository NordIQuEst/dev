<!-- Popular scientific presentations for high school students. -->

Quantum computing is becoming increasingly important in today's world, with potential applications in fields such as medicine, finance, and energy.
However, it is a complex and difficult subject to learn, which is why it is crucial to introduce it to young people at an early age.
This is where initiatives such as the [Young Ambassadors Program](https://www.youngambassadors.no/) come in,
providing high school students with the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge technology and its potential applications.

One of the highlights of the program on the 30th of January this year was a presentation on quantum technology by [Franz G. Fuchs from SINTEF Digital](https://www.sintef.no/alle-ansatte/ansatt/franz.fuchs/)
and member of the NordIQuEst project. Fuchs used visual aids such as Schr√∂dinger's cats in shoe boxes to explain concepts such as entanglement,
making the subject more accessible and engaging for the students.

Quantum technology is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe the behavior of matter and energy on a very small scale.
It is a highly complex and abstract subject, and many experts believe that it will revolutionize the world of computing, providing solutions
to previously unsolvable problems. Fuchs' presentation was an excellent example of how to make complex ideas accessible to a younger audience.
Using relatable examples and visual aids, he was able to explain the fundamental concepts of quantum technology in an engaging and memorable way.

Introducing quantum technology to high school students is essential for preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers.
By providing students with hands-on experience and exposure to cutting-edge technology, initiatives such as the Young Ambassadors Program
are helping to inspire the next generation of innovators. This is also a core mission for the NordIQuEst project: to influence young students
with a first-hand experience on what could be achieved with a quantum computer.
